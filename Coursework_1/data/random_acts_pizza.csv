blubirdhvn,"Hello! It's been a hard 2 months with money and I listed some goodies on craigslist so I could make some food money for my family and the people never showed up =(  The cupboards are empty, no bread or P&amp;J. Is there anyone that wouldn't mind helping me out tonight? My family would appreciate it so very much. Thank you for your time in reading our plea.   Edit: Tarn33 Came to are rescue and soon my family will be enjoying some much needed pizza!",True
queen_mcgina,"I'm exhausted from this week, and I'll be honest, I don't want to cook. My kids have played their little hearts out today and we're all in agreement that a pizza would really hit the spot (and really, when could it not?) They go out to their dad's house all next week and this would be a great close to the busy, hot week. Can you help us out?",False
Fhanky,"I really miss my best friend Brittney and I don't get to talk to her much since I am a full time student, have a 2 year old and work full time. I would love for her to know how much I miss her! ",False
djPARADISE,we have used all of our food money for a month because me and my brother and friend just finished remodeling my brothers room because his room was ugly looking hahahah. and we dont get paid till monday and we were just wondering if any of you noble people of RAOP will give us something that will feed 3 hungry people! thank you :] if you are interested i will give you 3 dollars on the psn store for exchange.,False
or_me_bender,"I've been unemployed going on three months now, and unfortunately my student girlfriend's part time job at the pharmacy doesn't leave much left over for anything but rice. Here's hoping for a hot pizza.",True
RitalinYourMemory,"I'm not in College, or a starving artist or anything like that. I've just been a bit unlucky lately. I'm a 36 year old single guy with a job. But rent, and other bills killed me this month. I thought I had enough funds in my account to at least keep me set with Mr. Noodles, I forgot about my monthly banking fee.  I had a small bag of chips Wednesday afternoon, and I get paid Monday, so I'll be fine then.. It's just really painful at this point and food is something I'm constantly thinking about.  I've got a few bucks to get on the bus to work on Saturday, so I can't really use that.  I'm really embarrassed to even be asking like this and I'm not sure how it works, so please be patient with me.  I guess that covers it. Thank you in advance.  Cheers folks.",True
nickgenova,basically i have $16 to last me the next week. i don't have enough gas to get home. i get paid on the 2nd and will return the favor!,False
Phredman,"I doubt anyone will send. But if you do, I'd be happy to take pics of me enjoying the pizza. I like Italian sausage and bacon.",False
taterpot,"I'm sure there are needier people on this subreddit, but I had to borrow 30 bucks to pay the rest of my share of rent yesterday and now I'm broke until next friday.  Pizza for me and my housemate that lent me the 30 bucks would be much appreciated for dinner.  Thanks in advance, it's subreddits like this that make Reddit such an awesome place. EDIT:CayucosKid got me covered, 2 pizzas, breadsticks, and a 2 liter of coke to boot!  I'll be eating good for days!  Thanks again.  (=",True
m_chamberlin,"I ran out of money on my meal card a while back, and finished the last of my easymac/sandwich stuff yesterday. Luckily for me the term is almost over, so I only need to survive for another week. A pizza would really help lighten that burden, and I could stretch it out to last. If you send anything my way, I'd love to write you a song telling you how awesome you are and record it.  Edit: As far as my music, I do orchestral/soundtrack like stuff, and some folk and jazz.",True
